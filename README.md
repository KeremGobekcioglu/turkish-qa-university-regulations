# Turkish Question Answering System for University Regulations

This project is a fine-tuned BERT-based question answering system designed specifically for understanding Turkish university regulations. It features a web interface where users can input natural language questions and receive context-based answers.

## ðŸ§  Project Summary

- Fine-tuned BERT model on a Turkish QA dataset derived from university regulation documents.
- A simple Flask web interface to test model predictions.
- Custom preprocessing pipeline to prepare QA pairs from context passages.
